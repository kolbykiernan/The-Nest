## About the Project

The Nest is designed to make it easier to choose guests who will attend your wedding by ranking and categorizing them. Down the road, the same information will be used to return a mock seating chart.

### Built With
The Nest requires the following to run:
* Node.JS 
* Express.JS
* React.JS
* PostgreSQL
* React Bootstrap

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To start, run:   
    npm install npm@latest -g    

### Installation:

1. Clone the repo
    git clone [https://github.com/kolbykiernan/wedding-app.git](https://github.com/kolbykiernan/wedding-app.git)

2. Install NPM packages      
    main folder -> npm install       
    cd frontend -> npm install      
    cd backend -> npm install       

## Usage
Users will sign up, log in, or choose the demo version to get started. Users will fill out info about their wedding details, create categories, and then fill out weedin party and other guests. After this section users will be directed to a guestlist, where they can further make edits to their guest list, then fill out info about their wedding venue, how many people they want to have come, and the cost per person. Based on guest valules assigned, this will return a list with those that do an don't make the cut for attending the wedding. Down the road, this info will be able to return a seating chart.

## Roadmap

* Enhanced User Profile Settings    
* Attach Contact Info to Guests
